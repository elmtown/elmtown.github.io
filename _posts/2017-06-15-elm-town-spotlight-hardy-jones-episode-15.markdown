# Preface

First thing, I apologize profusely for the embarrassingly terrible recording from my side. I'm taking steps to avoid that happening again in the future.

Second, the coupon code for Daily Drip is now "elmtown-2017", and still gets you $9 off, but doesn't give you a free month, since they no longer have the $9 plan available.

Here's a little pre-roll that explains those things in audio form:

That's all! Here's the show:
